## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps:

1. #### **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Melli007/ConoPizza-web.git

 
#### 2. **Configure the Backend**  

   - Locate the appsettings.json file.
   - Update the ConnectionStrings section with your own connection string. For example:  

          {      
            "ConnectionStrings": {  
              "DefaultConnection": "Server=YOUR_SERVER;Database=YOUR_DATABASE;UserId=YOUR_USER;Password=YOUR_PASSWORD;"  
            },  
            // ... other settings  
          }          
#### 3. **Run Database Migrations**  
 - Open the Package Manager Console (PMC) in Visual Studio.

 - Ensure the Default Project in PMC is set to the correct location.

 - Create and apply the migrations to set up your database:

- **To create a new migration:**
  ```bash
   Add-Migration InitialCreate  
- **To apply the migration and update the database:**
  ```bash
    Update-Database
 - This process creates the necessary tables in your database as defined in your entity models.
#### 4. **User Account Creation**
- When the Backend runs for the first time, it seeds an admin user into the database.
- The data seeding logic in DataSeeder.cs is designed to prevent reseeding on subsequent runs.
- To access the admin panel, navigate to:
  ```bash
    https://localhost:7030/admin/login
Then log in using:
  - **Username:** Admin 
  - **Password:** Admin123!
